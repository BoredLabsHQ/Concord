But at more "reasonable" speeds it can tolerate it.
ime decoupling only cuts down on noise, if you want to actually cut vibrations you need mass
It's barely making a difference at super extreme speeds
You prob need like 0.02
But if the product needs to be precise
You won't lose much
So I immediately thought he meant nozzle
Because he said needs shipping
I assumed that as well.
I can't tell if the hula is helping or just making it worse
I assumed 0.2 nozzle
I'm so silly and dumb
Thank you
Omg that's what their saying
That's fine
Sweeeeet
are you sure they're not saying .2 layer height rather than .2 nozzle?
Like. I don't see anywhere here that has any specific details. unless I'm blind.
Could also be better since 0.04 are better at overhands than 0.02 from what I heard.

I mean... stl is still stl. You make that go through slicer, you get gcode with 0.04 settings, nothing much changes
then there's no reason to use a .2 nozzle
That's alright there's 0 detail
not loss of quality but rather loss of detail
It doesn't actually make sense cause it's a deck box. It doesn't really need the accuracy of a 0.02 nozzle.
That was made for 0.02
Like you wanna download an stl file that was made for 0.04?
Uhmmm. Wdym?
It should turn out fine
In hindsight. It was dumb not getting a 0.2
I didn't buy a 0.02 nozzle and don't really wanna wait the 2 weeks it takes Bambu to ship to wait to try to print this.
Other then loss of quality.
What's the consequence of building a 0.02 print with a 0.04
Hehehhehehe...
less retraction requirements
Much lower pressure advance values too
some much smarter folks in here on the topic than i
finer control, plus TPU
why do people mod enders to be direct drive? what does direct drive really do better than bowden? (printing with PLA)
lol
they cut a 300 dollar hotend in half
ok thats skill
I sent it last night search my messages from last night
i'd take a flat file to the flat spots and rip all that crap smooth
<@175887283097042944> got a file?
Rip
Because I need to put it outside with candy inside rn
some person turned an old ender into a wire EDM cutter
Why don't you print the 6 sides independent of each other ðŸ¤”

better yes, but still needs,  like take all the stringies
nah just try to fix it and have 2 printers :3 just dont' sink any money into it
Better?
Noice!
Yes way
Cool! I really want to make my own printer some day, but I'm getting an a1combo soon and will be busy with that. I was gonna sell my fake ender 3 pro but it's worth so little that I might as well keep all the parts and use it if I ever made a printer myself. I'll learn to model over the next year or so and try to take on the task!
Strange. I only have 1 ball gap
the worse it will get until it fails
the more balls you're missing
so usually there's like 2 balls worth of gap floating in the carriage, if you have more t hen that then you could endup just less smoothly moving depending on how the spacing ends up distributing,  im sure one of the engineers will corerct me if im wrong in my understanding
Yeah mb. there might be another way, I would just look it up or honestly ask chatGPT
I found it. Can I still try get a benchy in under 40 min?
and don't try to do speed benchies
just replace it when you can
1 ball should be fine
just remember cut away from your thumb
lol
So better to make it clean than have any stringing coming off for effect lll
I ofund it though, thank god they're magnetic
As soon as one goes missing my head just feels so much hotter
xacto then
Well those top teeth are goners
These ball bearing bring me an unimagineable amoutn of stress
then guess you need to go start gently pulling with pliers / nippers at all that xtra strings
I donâ€™t have one
run your deburr tool over all the strings
no way
hmm I tried but revolve just made it into a complete circle
This look better?
we should c ollectively come up with a halloween candy dispenser project for next year, with the c heapest possible buildcost and as few possible parts that aren't 3d printed
why do i feel like im going to have alot of leftover Candy after tonight
Like, will the rail just not work?
Is it bad>
Hehehe https://youtu.be/qua5Fl7u_HI?si=Izo-W0sNQpvZZ38t
I'm missing a singular ball
<:monkakarp:596704350919852042>  share plz
all you need is a digital caliper and youll be good
I'm scared
Not to brag, but I did make a cool little video for it!
https://tenor.com/view/bob-the-builder-gif-21863917
even seeing how some popular printer designs are still crappy just illustrates the knowledge gap in making good printers
ah understandable. still crazy impressive.
So it's not completely my own design,
going to school for cs instead of engineering is one of my few regrets in life
Ducky0 is derived from Voron0
theyre all mechanical engineers
It shouldn't cause too much problems, right?
Nah, a good engineer takes an existing design and makes it **BETTER** <:vaulthah:597787241812852736>
A single ball on one side
WIll my linear bearing be fine if I'm missing a single ball?
