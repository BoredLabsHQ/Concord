    <h1>Concord</h1>
    <h2>An AI Plugin for Decentralized, Networked Communities</h2>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Concord is an AI-powered, open-source plugin aimed at revolutionizing communication within digital communities, especially those pioneering network states and edge cities. It offers a platform where collaboration, privacy, and user sovereignty are core values. Designed to foster serendipity and streamline conversations across multiple platforms, Concord connects and empowers communities by unlocking Web3 solutions, including decentralized identity and reputation, with plans to experiment with hardware integration.</p>

        <h3>Why Concord Matters for Networked Communities</h3>
        <p>Concord provides a toolkit for communities aiming to self-organize, make meaningful connections, and retain autonomy over their data and identities. In network states and “edge cities,” where governance and digital interaction blend, Concord’s decentralized approach meets a critical need for secure, user-centered infrastructure. By focusing on cross-platform discovery, decentralized identity, and data privacy, Concord offers communities a powerful foundation to coordinate their visions.</p>
